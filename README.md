### Recommendations
- Increase advertising efforts for lower-performing products to enhance visibility and boost sales.
- Conduct further analysis to understand the reasons behind the low performance of the Mid Market and Channel Partner segments.
- Expand advertising efforts to additional countries to increase overall sales and profits. Implement targeted advertising strategies in countries with lower sales to improve performance.
- Enhance advertising and promotional efforts during months with lower sales to boost overall sales and profitability.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis reveals that Paseo stands out as the top product in terms of sales and profit, significantly outperforming competitors. The Government segment leads in overall profitability, highlighting the need for targeted advertising to improve the performance of underperforming products and segments, especially in markets with diminished sales. Monthly performance data suggests an opportunity to enhance sales during underperforming months, such as January and August, through increased promotional activities. Additionally, the discount structure presents a strategic opportunity for pricing optimization to further drive sales. By implementing these recommendations, the company can maximize its market presence and profitability.
